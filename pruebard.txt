Hey-hey-hey
Yeah-ah
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the Earth to the Sun
Now, the air I tasted and breathe has taken a turn
Mmm, and all I taught her was everything
Mmm-hmm, I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
All the pictures had all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So, why do I sear?
Mmm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinning, oh-oh, I'm spinning
How quick the Sun can drop away?
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am
All I'll be, yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh
I know someday, you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky
But why, why, why can't it be
Oh, can't it be mine?
Ooh
Ah, yeah
Ah, ooh-ooh
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (oh, oh-yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo doo doo, doo, doo-doo-doo (ah-ah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (ah-ah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (ah-ah, yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (yeah, ah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-hoo
